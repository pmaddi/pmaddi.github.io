Authentication is hard

Two factor auth doesnt go far enough

We deliver a random order to you, and you type in what you got.



	Doesnt require a phone
	Ensures you're in the right location
	You can't get on <service> for another 30-60 mins
	You get food
	Relies on the food delivery network to get you your food
