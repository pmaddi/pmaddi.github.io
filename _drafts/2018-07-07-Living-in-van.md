Get a van. I found mine on craigslist. Make sure to get a bill of sale signed by both parties and the title to the vehicle. Go to the dmv to pay the taxes and get the vehicle registered.

I like to park in Long Island City, Queens. I spend most of my time at Brooklyn Boulders, which is a climbing gym with large coworking spaces inside of it. Everyone there is friendly and kind. They only close for 7-9 hours per day. There are plenty of bathrooms and outlets inside. There is plenty of street parking outiside the gym too.
