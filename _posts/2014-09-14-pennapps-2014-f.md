If you've ever tried to make a solid login system, you know that authentication is pretty tough.

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication):
> Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is an approach to authentication which requires the presentation of two or more of the three independent authentication factors: a knowledge factor ("something only the user knows"), a possession factor ("something only the user has"), and an inherence factor ("something only the user is")


Two factor auth doesnt go far enough
