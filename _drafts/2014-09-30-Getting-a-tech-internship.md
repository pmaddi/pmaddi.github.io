google in person (4 interviews)
interview 1
- started with coin dynamic programming problem, but saw that I already knew how to do it.
you need to find the maximum subset of a string containting at most n unique characters.
for example ABAACABDE => 7
solution:
    maintian head and tail indicies as well as a table of counts
    O(N) time

interview 2:
you have a sparse spreadsheet
implement:
    get, put remove, getCol, getRow
my solution:
    idk if best
    have table of cols to list of guids, table of rows to guids, and guid to (r, c, value) map

interview 3:
flip number over = original number?

then, generate all numbers where flipped = original
solution: simple dynamic programming
def generate(n):
    if not n:
        return
    first = ['']
    second = ['0', '1', '2', '5', '8']
    while len(second[0]) <= n:
        new_one = []
        for i in ['00', '11', '22', '55', '88', '69', '96']:
            for j in first:
                new_one.append(i[0] + j + i[1])
        first = second
        second = new_one
    return second

interview 4:
kinda weird, design a class interface that takes inputs of ranges and then given a number, returns whether it is in one of the ranges

the final solution required inserting ranges into a sorted list using binary search in log(n) time and looking up if a number is in the range in log(n) time as well
