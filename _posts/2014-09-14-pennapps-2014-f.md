How do you know that the person logging into your system is the real user? Well, you need to use a form of Multi-Factor Authentication.

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication):
> Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is an approach to authentication which requires the presentation of two or more of the three independent authentication factors: a knowledge factor ("something only the user knows"), a possession factor ("something only the user has"), and an inherence factor ("something only the user is")

The knowlege factor is a given when using a password. Over the web, inherence factors (fingerprints, DNA, vessel patterns, etc.) are out of the question.

The key here is the knowlege factor. Get a secure key to your user to verify identity. Sounds simple, but 

This means that you need to get a key to your user via a secure system.

Normally, MFA systems use a cellphone as the _possession factor_.
